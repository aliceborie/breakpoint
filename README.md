### What is breakpoint?
<p>
  Breakpoint is a custom video player designed especially for learning. 
  Videos are split into digestible segments by "breakpoints." 
  You can easily pause, replay, and skip between these meaningful segments 
  (they have titles and descriptions as well) with a single tap of the finger. 
  No more manual rewinding or memorizing your favorite parts - breakpoint has you covered.
